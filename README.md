`tsid` is a [Caddy] plugin that restricts access only to requests
coming from the [Tailscale] network and allows to identify users
behind these requests by setting some [Caddy] [placeholders]:

| Placeholder                  | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| {http.vars.tailscale.name}   | User name   |
| {http.vars.tailscale.email}  | User email  |

## Usage

- Build Caddy with this plugin by [xcaddy]:

        $ xcaddy build --with go.astrophena.name/tsid

- Make sure that `tsid` is ordered first:

        {
          order tsid first
        }

- Add the `tsid` directive to your Caddyfile and use the placeholders:

        tsid
        
        respond "Hello, {http.vars.tailscale.name}"
